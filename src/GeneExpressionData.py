class GeneExpressionData():
    '''
    This class is responsible for taking high-throughput yeast gene expression data and converting it into usable input features for our the PredictionModel. It's primary function is creating a lookup table that maps pairs of genes to the normalized pearson correlations between their experimental conditions in each of the input datasets.
